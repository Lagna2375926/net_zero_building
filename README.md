# Net Zero Building Simulation Platform
A web-based simulation tool for designing and analyzing net zero energy buildings in India. This project uses BIM and smart technology concepts to calculate real-time energy performance and construction costs, dynamically updating results as you change building area, orientation, and efficiency features.
## Features
1. Interactive 3D Visualization: Adjust building area and orientation, and see the changes instantly in a 3D model.
2. Dynamic Energy Calculations: Lighting, equipment, HVAC, and solar gains calculated per Indian ECBC standards, scaling with building area.
3. Smart Technology Integration: Evaluate the impact of smart sensors and controls on energy savings.
4. INR Cost Analysis: All costs and savings are presented in Indian Rupees for local relevance.
